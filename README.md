## Summary

- **What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?**
    The main disadvantage that was observed during analysis was the time and customization of the original script, however, the whole process was worth it becuase the refactored code was more organized, had very adequate readability, and saved more time when analyzing for the end result, which were considered the main advantages.

- **How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring code in the original VBA script ?**
    While the code maintainability overall was better in the refactored code, and the code was easier to understand and read with less complex structure, It was time consuming to tailor the original code into refactored code while maintaining the whole structure of the original script and also during the process sometimes it was a bit confusing when trying to figure out how to tie the variables together in the refactored code.
