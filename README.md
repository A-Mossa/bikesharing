## Summary

- This service proved valuabel specifically to male customers in NYC according the data collected. apparently it is not only used for leisure, because looking at the peak hours of usage we can tell that NewYorkers rely on CitiBike to commute around the city during rush hour .

## Additional Visualtions:

- Given the time I believe my friend and I would have performed more visualizations on different seasons of the year to monitor dips or increases in usage.
Keeping in mind that this analysis was carried out for a summer month of August with a lot of tourists and visitors.

- It would be beneficial to the investors if they could figure out the maintaince cycle for each bike through the visualization of usage and the type of weather for a certain duration.
